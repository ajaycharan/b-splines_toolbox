# b-splines_toolbox

project_3.m :

    -   Deploying this runs the main program. A GUI appears and the user may
        click a set of points that interpolate a b-spline curve. The curve is
        drawn as soon as the user has clicked at least 5 points. The spline will be
        redrawn and updated with each subsequent click. Also drawn are the computed
        Bezier points. 

    -   This program satisfies problem 5, 6, and 7

    -   If you want to change the end condition for the interpolation, 
        change the value of "econd" in this file.
